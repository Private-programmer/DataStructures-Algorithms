# DataStructures-Algorithms

Hello this is DataStructures and algorithms. This is all in java.

data structures, searching and sorting algorithms explored:

self made implementation of below and then using java libraries for these

    - stacks [done]
    - queues [done]
    - priority queuepq [TODO: ]
    - linked lists [TODO: may need more logic on linked list]
    - doubly linked lists [TODO: may need more logic on linked list]
    - hashsets, hashtable and hashmaps
    - Heap
    - sort
        - selection sort
        - insertion sort
        - merge sort
        - quick sort
    - Search
        - linear search
        - binary search
        - trees
            - DFS
            - BFS
